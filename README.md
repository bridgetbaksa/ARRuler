# ARRuler
Ever needed to measure something but didn't have a ruler on hand? Now you can measure anything on the go with Augmented Reality! This iOS app takes the distance of two points that you choose and displays the distance on screen.

*Note - the preview has debug mode enabled to show where ARKit is detecting a plane (if you were wondering what all of those yellow dots where) :)

This app is inspired by the projects on The App Brewery's Complete App Development Bootcamp. Check out the full course at www.appbrewery.co
